# WP04: Reply Helpers

## Objective
Enable the AI to post replies to Figma comments in-thread.

## Tasks

1. **Implement `post_comment_reply` function**
   - Input: `{ file_key, parent_comment_id, message }`
   - Use Figma API to post reply to thread
   - Handle rate limiting and errors

2. **Standardize status strings**
   - `Queued ⏳` - Task received and waiting
   - `Working…` - Task in progress
   - `Needs input ❓` - Awaiting user confirmation
   - `Done ✅` - Task completed successfully
   - `Failed 🧨` - Task failed with error

3. **Implement immediate "ack" reply**
   - Post "Queued ⏳" immediately when task is received
   - Include brief summary of understood command

## Deliverables

- [ ] `figma-mcp-server/src/figma/comment-client.ts`
- [ ] Status string constants
- [ ] Unit tests for reply formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

- Replies appear correctly in Figma comment thread
- Status emojis render correctly
- Rate limiting handled gracefully
